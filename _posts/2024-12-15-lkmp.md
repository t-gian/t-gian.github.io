## **My Journey Through the Linux Kernel Mentorship Program**  

### **Introduction**  
Participating in the Linux Kernel Mentorship Program (LKMP) has been one of the most rewarding experiences I've been through. As a cybersecurity enthusiast and student deeply passionate about open-source development, contributing to the Linux Kernel was an incredible opportunity to apply my knowledge, learn advanced kernel concepts, and grow as a developer.  

During the three-month full-time program, I had a goal of five patches, which I exceeded by contributing **seven patches** across different subsystems, including [**CVE-2024-50143**](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50143). I worked on bugs related to different subsystems and learned to use tools such as fuzzers (Syzkaller), static analysis (Smatch, Coverity), while enhancing with my skills with gdb and kernel programming. In addition, I've honed my skills with memory and address sanitizers and the ftrace utility.

Balancing the program with other responsibilities, such as a concurrent research job, tech interviews, and master thesis preparations, made this journey even more challenging but deeply fulfilling.  

### **About the Linux Kernel Mentorship Program**  
The LKMP, sponsored by [The Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org/), is designed to help developers contribute to the Linux Kernel under the guidance of experienced maintainers. Over a fixed period of time, mentees work on real-world kernel bugs providing patches, collaborate with the community, and gain invaluable hands-on experience.  

### **Application Process**  
The application process guided me through tasks like building the kernel, writing small kernel modules, and analyzing stack traces. I completed the application during my vacation, where I decoded my first stack trace of a bug reported by **Syzkaller**, which eventually became my main focus during the program. Shortly after submitting, I received my acceptance email, marking the beginning of my journey. 

### **Fixing Bugs with Syzkaller**  
My main activity involved [Syzkaller](https://github.com/google/syzkaller), a state-of-the-art kernel fuzzer developed by Google to identify runtime bugs. It works by generating random system calls to stress-test the kernel, uncovering subtle issues like memory corruptions, overflows, and race conditions, paired kernel sanitizers such as **KASAN**, **KMSAN** and so on.

In my case, Syzkaller was the primary tool I used to identify and fix bugs. Most of my efforts revolved around:  
- **Debugging stack traces**: Understanding how crashes occurred and isolating the problematic code.  
- **Reproducing issues**: Setting up controlled environments to replicate crashes.  
- **Patching and testing**: Writing patches to fix the issues and validating the solutions.  

For example, I worked on bugs in the **UDF filesystem**, including the CVE mentioned above, and the **bcachefs filesystem**, learning about file systems in depth as I tackled these challenging bugs, working on uninit-value-use, ase-after-free bugs and such which are main CVEs listed bugs.  
### **CVE-2024-50143**
One of the most significant accomplishments during my time in the Linux Kernel Mentorship Program was fixing **CVE-2024-50143**, a vulnerability I identified and patched in the **UDF filesystem**. This bug, reported by **Syzkaller** was labelled as an **uninitialized-value-use** bug.

I traced back the issue to a missing overflow check on tainted input data when finding the final extent in **`udf_current_aext()`**, which led to uninitialized memory access in **`udf_get_fileshortad()`**. I added a check to prevent the overflow, effectively fixing the root cause behind the uninitialized value use bug reported by **KMSAN**.

The patch I submitted was not only merged into the mainline but also backported to all affected stable releases. Here is the link to the commit that addressed the vulnerability:

[Fix for CVE-2024-50143](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit/?id=5eb76fb98b3335aa5cca6a7db2e659561c79c32b)

The bug was initially reported by Syzkaller:  
[Syzkaller Bug - CVE-2024-50143](https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=8901c4560b7ab5c2f9df)

This patch marked my first contribution to resolving a CVE, a milestone I am particularly proud of, given my long-lasting interest for security.

### **Static Analyzers: Smatch and Coverity**  
In the second half of the program, I began using **Smatch** and **Coverity**, two powerful static analysis tools, to identify and fix kernel bugs:
- [**Coverity**](https://scan.coverity.com/): A comprehensive analysis tool that flags potential defects across the codebase. Coverity helped me find less obvious issues that required deeper code understanding. By leveraging it I also have an applied patch in the net subsystem, another subsystem that interests me.
- [**Smatch**](https://lwn.net/Articles/691882/): A semantic checker for C programs that detects logical errors, uninitialized variables, and type mismatches.


### **Exploring Diverse Subsystems**  
One of the most enriching aspects of the program was working across various subsystems, as my main focus is on cybersecurity, but the security subsystem had no reported open bugs to the public:  
- **Filesystems**: I fixed different bugs in **UDF** and **bcachefs**.  
- **Networking**: I resolved an uninit-pointer-read in the network subsystem.  
- **Other subsystems**: By intentionally diversifying my work, I challenged myself to understand different areas of the kernel rather than focusing solely on a single module.  

This decision was driven by my long-term goal of gaining a broader view of kernel development. While there weren’t security subsystem bugs during my time, I found the process of patching and debugging across other areas to be just as educational and rewarding. 

### **Learning and Growth**  
To complement my hands-on work, I read the [Linux Kernel Development](https://www.amazon.com/Linux-Kernel-Development-Robert-Love/dp/0672329468) book by Robert Love, which provided theoretical insights into the kernel’s architecture and design principles.

Additionally, the mentorship improved my skills in:  
- **Security tools**: Working with fuzzers like Syzkaller, static analyzers, and debugging tools gave me a deeper understanding of how to identify, fix, and patch vulnerabilities.  
- **Debugging**: Analyzing stack traces, reproducing crashes, and debugging complex runtime bugs.
- **Open-source collaboration**: I learned how to write clean, well-documented patches and communicate effectively with experienced maintainers.  

### **Mentorship and Community**  
I’m immensely grateful to my mentor, **Shuah Khan**, whose weekly meetings and feedback were invaluable.

The Linux Kernel community also provided a supportive environment, where I could reach out for guidance and share knowledge with fellow mentees.  

### **Under Review and Future Plans** 
Several of my patches are currently under review, and I plan to contribute more in the future. As a cybersecurity enthusiast, I’m particularly interested in diving deeper into **Linux Security Modules (LSM)** and patching bugs related to kernel security.  

### **Conclusion**  
Participating in the Linux Kernel Mentorship Program has been a transformative journey. Despite balancing multiple commitments, I exceeded my initial goals, gained experience in debugging, patching, and collaborating within the open-source community, and contributed to different kernel subsystems. 

The knowledge I’ve gained, from fuzzing and static analysis to debugging runtime issues, has solidified my commitment to open-source development and cybersecurity. I am proud to have contributed to the Linux Kernel, and I look forward to making even more impactful contributions in the future.  

If you’re passionate about open-source development, I strongly encourage you to apply for the [Linux Kernel Mentorship Program](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/). Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced developer, the program will guide you in becoming a meaningful contributor to one of the most significant OSS projects.
